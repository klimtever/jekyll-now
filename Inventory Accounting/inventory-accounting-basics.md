## What is Inventory?

Inventory is the raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and merchandise that a business has on its premises or out on consignment at any given time.

* _Raw materials_
* _Work-in-process_
* _Finished goods_: This is products that completed the manufacturing process, and which are ready for sale.
* _Merchandise_


## Inventory Record Accuracy

### Inventory Record Errors

•   Received goods are not recorded at all •   A receipt is recorded against the wrong item, or in the wrong quantity •   Goods are putaway and the location is not recorded •   Goods are putaway and the location is incorrectly recorded Picking activities •   The wrong quantity or the wrong product is picked •   A picker correctly picks an item, but scans the wrong bar code •   A picking transaction is not recorded, or recorded twice •   Picked goOds are assigned to the wrong customer order •   A counting scale is incorrectly used, resulting in the wrong pick quantity Data entry •   The quantity picked is transposed when entering the information •   Data entry does not occur until the following day Cycle and physical counting •   A counting error is discovered that is actually caused by late data entry of a prior transaction, resulting in a correcting entry that compounds the problem •   An inexperienced person incorrectly counts inventory during a physical count, resulting in the “correction” of an on-hand balance •   A data entry person assumes the wrong unit of measure, such as rolls instead of inches

Another major factor that impacts record accuracy is, curiously, the **capacity level** at which a facility is operating.

Another factor that impacts record accuracy is the **speed of operations**.

### Backflushing
Backflushing is the concept of waiting until the manufacture of a product has been completed, and then recording all of the related issuances of inventory from stock that were required to create the product.

### Controls over Record Accuracy

Ideally, it should only be necessary to record an inventory-related transaction once, and then assume that the entry was made correctly.

| Shipping department sends incorrect quanties | xxx |
| Putaway errors | xxx |

#### Advantages of immutable events
Immutability in databases is an old idea. For example, accountants have been using immutability for centuries in financial bookkeeping. When a transaction occurs, it is recorded in an append-only ledger, which is essentially a log of events describing money, goods, or services that have changed hands. The accounts, such as profit and loss or the balance sheet, are derived from the transactions in the ledger by adding them up [53].
If a mistake is made, accountants don’t erase or change the incorrect transaction in the ledger—instead, they add another transaction that compensates for the mistake, for example refunding an incorrect charge. The incorrect transaction still remains in the ledger forever, because it might be important for auditing reasons. If incorrect figures, derived from the incorrect ledger, have already been published, then the fig‐ ures for the next accounting period include a correction. This process is entirely nor‐ mal in accounting [54].

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist          | Album          | Year |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| Michael Jackson | Thriller       | 1982 |
| Prince          | Purple Rain    | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys    | License to Ill | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
var foo = "bar";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var foo = "bar";
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```javascript
var foo =
  "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language   | Code               |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Javascript | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby       | `foo = "bar"`      |

---

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![Octocat](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/octocat.png)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![Branching](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
